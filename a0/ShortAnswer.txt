1. Assume I plan to use the friend_overlap function above to quantify the
similarity of two users. E.g., because 344 is larger than 1, I conclude that
Jill Stein and Gary Johnson are more similar than Hillary Clinton and Donald
Trump.

How is this approach misleading? How might you fix it?

Answer:
    1. The number of set of users followed by Jill Stein and Gary Johnson are much bigger than the user set count followed by Hillary Clinton
       and Donald Trump. So directly comparing the number of common users for their similarity is completely invalid.
    2. If we compare the common number of users they follow Jill and Gary have 344 users common as compare to Hillary and Donald which
       have just 1 user in common. But from these values we can not say that the Jill and Gary are more similar than Hillary and Donald.
    3. As we don't know the types of person they follow, and the number of people of particular field they are following we can not
       predict their similarity.
    4. Lets take an example:
        If two user A nd B follow 100 users from same Domain, however user C and D follow 10 specific person from 10 specific fields in common.
        So considering this example we can not say that person A and B are more similar than person C and D. Because they have just
        one field similar. However person C and D have more similarity. So these numbers can be misleading.
    5. The approach to fix this problem is we will find the sets of type of users the given users follow. Analyse the data, consider the similarity
       between these users and then conclude regarding the users similarity.
    6. Instead of comparing the common user count we can check the similarity using some similarity formulae such as Jaccard Similarity. which will be
       more accurate for comparing similarities between two users.



2. Looking at the output of your followed_by_hillary_and_donald function, why
do you think this user is followed by both Hilary Clinton and Donald Trump,
who are rivals? Do some web searches to see if you can find out more
information.

Answer:
    1. The common user followed by Hillary and Donald is Magic Johnson. Magic Johnson is an retired American Basketball player and a well known Business man.
       As a basketball player anyone can follow him.
    2. Magic Johnson supports Hillary Clinton as a political leader. That might be one of the reason why Hillary follows Magic Johnson.
    3. However Magic Johnson is also a business man, Donal trump too has business career. That might be one of the reason why Donald trump follows Magic Johnson.


3. There is a big difference in how many accounts each candidate follows (Gary
Johnson follows over 3K accounts, while Donald Trump follows less than
50). Why do you think this is? How might that affect our analysis?

Answer:
    1. Donald trump has 11.4 Million followers however Gary Johnson has only 315.00 Thousand followers.
    2. To convey any message (Tweet) to people Donald trump do not need friends so that he deliver his message to large number of public.
       However Gary Johnson will have to add more friends to pass a single message to many people. Thus if Gary Johnson add more friends or follows more people,
       his message will be delivered to max number of users. Then when they re-tweet there followers will get to know.
       And because of this Gary Johnson needs to follow more friend than Donald Trump.
    3. As the data set is completely different in size we can not analyse the data properly. We can not predict the similarity between
       two users based on this data set as there is a large difference in number of users followed by both users.


4. The follower graph we've collected is incomplete. To expand it, we would
have to also collect the list of accounts followed by each of the
friends. That is, for each user X that Donald Trump follows, we would have to
also collect all the users that X follows. Assuming we again use the API call
https://dev.twitter.com/rest/reference/get/friends/ids, how many requests will
we have to make? Given how Twitter does rate limiting
(https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public/rate-limiting), approximately how many
minutes will it take to collect this data?

Answer: Considering our given code to collect data for all given candidates:
    Donald Trump
    1. Total request for Donald trump is 42 req for his friends and 1 req for himself
       Total request = 1 + 42 = 43.
       For first call we dont have to wait, so waiting time is zero for 15 requests.
       For next 2 calls 15 req per call(30 requests), so waiting time will be 15 minutes each call.
       Total Time taken for 43 requests = 30 minutes.

    Hillary Clinton
    2. Total request for Hillary Clinton is 748 req for her friends and 1 req for herself
       Total request = 1 + 748 = 749.
       For next 50 calls 15 req per call(749 requests), so waiting time will be 15 minutes each call.
       Total Time taken for 749 requests = 750 minutes.

    Gary Johnson
    3. Total request for Gary Johnson is 3124 req for his friends and 1 req for himself
       Total request for Gary Johnson is 3124 req for his friends and 1 req for himself
       Total request = 1 + 3124 = 3125.
       For next 209 calls 15 req per call(3125 requests), so waiting time will be 15 minutes each call.
       Total Time taken for 3125 requests = 3135 minutes.

    Jill Stein
    4. Total request for Jill Stein is 4159 req for his friends and 1 req for himself
       Total request for Jill Stein is 4159 req for his friends and 1 req for himself
       Total request = 1 + 4159 = 4160.
       For first call we dont have to wait, so waiting time is zero for 15 requests.
       For next 278 calls 15 req per call(4160 requests), so waiting time will be 15 minutes each call.
       Total Time taken for 4160 requests = 4170 minutes.

    So the total number of API calls (request) to collect this data = 43 + 749 + 3125 + 4160
                                                        = 8077 Requests.

    So the total time to collect this data = 30 + 750 + 3135 + 4170
                                           = 8085 minutes.

    To minimize time further what we can do is we can add all the user's id in a set, so all the common users request time will be
    cut down.
